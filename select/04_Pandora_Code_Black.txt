Pandora

Imagine yourself on distand planet
Engulfed and colour and beauty
A civilization thriving and living as one
A habitat so alive
It illuminates with wild
Unimaginable colors
A landscape so vast
Yet so interconnected to all aspects of life
Let the sound of tribal drumps to the air
And bring nature to life
