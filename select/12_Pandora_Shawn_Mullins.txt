We opened Pandora's box
Just to see if she was home
She had an apple pie a jaundiced eye
And a big red telephone
She said "boy's I know why you are here,
You wanna take me for a ride?
But before we go I think you ought to know
That I'm awful hard to hide
I'm awful hard to hide
So how will you do in this town boy's(sic)
How will you call him dead?
Will he die in his rack from a heart attack
Or from a bullet through his head?"
Then she whispered as we took her out
"He need not be afraid
'Cause deep inside the system hide's the truth
That you've betrayed the truth that you've betrayed."
Nowhere for us to run
Thirty silver pieces got the job done got the job done
Poor Pandora's life
It was not as it had been portrayed
A government, an accident and now the bed is made
And we tried to put her back
But we were defeated by our greed
Tried again while shadowmen did their dirty little deed
Their dirty little deed
We opened Pandora's box just to see what we could find
And in there was a note pandora wrote
Just before she lost her mind
It said "my passing will allow a peak(sic) behind the veil of secrecy
It's farther out than you can see
Just no telling where that trail will lead
No telling where that trail will lead."
